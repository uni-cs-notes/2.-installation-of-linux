2. **Insert USB Drive**: Insert your USB flash drive into a USB port on your computer. Ensure that the USB drive has enough capacity to accommodate the ISO file and any additional files required for the bootable environment.

3. **Launch Rufus**: Run the Rufus executable file that you downloaded.

4. **Select USB Drive**: In Rufus, under the "Device" dropdown menu, select your USB flash drive. Make sure you choose the correct drive as Rufus will erase all data on the selected drive.

5. **Select ISO File**: Under the "Boot selection" section, click on the "Select" button and navigate to the location where your ISO file is stored. Select the ISO file you want to use.

6. **Partition Scheme and File System**: Rufus will automatically detect the appropriate settings for your ISO file, but you can adjust these settings if needed. Generally, it's recommended to leave the default settings unless you have specific requirements.

7. **Start Creation**: Once you've selected the USB drive and ISO file and confirmed the settings, click on the "Start" button to begin the process of creating the bootable USB drive.

8. **Wait for Completion**: Rufus will format the USB drive and copy the contents of the ISO file to the drive. This process may take some time depending on the size of the ISO file and the speed of your USB drive.

9. **Completionüì¶Ô∏è**: Once Rufus has finished creating the bootable USB drive, you will see a message indicating that the process is complete. You can now safely eject the USB drive from your computer.

Your bootable USB drive is now ready for use. You can use it to boot your computer into the operating system or utility contained within the ISO file. Remember to configure your computer's BIOS or UEFI settings to boot from the USB drive if necessary.
